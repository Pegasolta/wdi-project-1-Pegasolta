## Synopsis

This game was created during my WDI course with General Assembly. It is modelled after Google's Chrome Dinosaur game, substituted with a Llama and with reduced difficulty to the extent it is in "God-Mode" easiness. The game is written in Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

## Instructions

Using spacebar on a keyboard, players will need to jump over obstacles in the form of rocks.   

## Version

1.0

## API

Query

## Possible Improvements

1) Background doesn't loop properly. Probably an issue with calculation of image vs screen sizes
2) Llama has "God-mode", such that keydown enables it to fly. Implementing a setTimeOut will solve this
3) Randomize size of obstacles. Obstacles are currently all the same
4) Implement score system based on time passed, allowing player to log high score
5) Copy start screen of Google Chrome's Dinosaur game, where only the Dinosaur is shown until first key is pressed
6) Implement multi-layered backgrounds
7) Implement different backgrounds - after running a certain distance, image fades out to another background. 
8) Ability to shoot projectiles and destroy obstacles that are too tall to jump over
9) And many more!
